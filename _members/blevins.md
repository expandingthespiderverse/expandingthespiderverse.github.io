## Cameron Blevins

I teach United States history and digital humanities at the University of Colorado Denver, where I am Associate Professor, Clinical Teaching Track in the History Department and the Director of Digital Initiatives for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. My book, Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West (Oxford University Press, 2021), presents a spatial interpretation of the nineteenth-century American state by mapping the sprawling infrastructure of the nation’s postal network. I also administer the Digital Studies Certificate at CU Denver, which helps students develop computational skills while understanding the relationship between those technologies and wider society. Some of my broader interests include geography, communications, the history of gender and sexuality, critical data studies, and information visualization.
