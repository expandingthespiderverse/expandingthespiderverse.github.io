Data Advocacy for All is an eight-module curriculum that leverages minimal computing and open-source tools to enhance student abilities to inquire with data, communicate with data, and deploy data for social advocacy.

Data Advocacy for All has been designed for students across the disciplines with no prior data science or computing experience. This college-level curriculum includes pedagogical modules, ready-made data sets, tutorials, links to open-source tools, and flexible curricular resources. 

Data Advocacy for All is a <a href="https://www.cu.edu/oaa/academic-innovation-programs/cu-next-award">CU Next Award Grant project<a/> that has been realized by a team of digital rhetoric and digital humanities faculty at CU Boulder and Denver in concert with CU Boulder’s Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS).

# What is Data Advocacy?
<br>
## Definition
<br>
“Data advocacy is an integrative practice of analysis, design, and communication in which insights from a dataset are effectively conveyed to raise public awareness and drive social change.” <small>(Laurie Gries, “A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Storytelling and Advocacy”)</small>
<br><br>
## Perspective
<br>
Data Advocacy for All teaches data advocacy through two main approaches:<br>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Data Feminism
<p class="card-text">Data feminism interrogates how data both propagates and resists sexism and other interlocking forces of oppression in order to create “more just, equitable, and livable futures” (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020, n.p.).</p>

<div class="card hoverable">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Rhetorical Data Studies
<p class="card-text">Rhetorical data studies (Gries, forthcoming) investigates the links between data, communication, and power in order to better understand how data-driven stories and arguments generate knowledge, garner public attention, and, among other actions, mediate socio-cultural change.</p>
